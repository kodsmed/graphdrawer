      <!--
        This page is a demo of the graphdrawer component and shows A WAY to use it in a HTML/JS context.
        The component is defined in the index.js file and is imported as a module.
        In the index.js file you also find examples of how to use the component and how to set its attributes in a pure JS context.

        The surrounding HTML is just a simple page with a title and a div to contain the component, nothing on this page is specific to the component itself and can be changed as needed to fit the context.

        The component does not have any dependencies on the surrounding HTML, it is self-contained and can be used in any HTML/JS context. See the README.md file for more information on how to use the component and what attributes it supports.
